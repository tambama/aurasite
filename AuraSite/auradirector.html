                                </h2>
                                <p>A 24 year old Zimbabwean entrepreneur Samuelle Dimairho, who recently returned to the country from the US, received the Global Student Entrepreneurs Award (GSEA) 2015 from the Entrepreneurs Organisation at an event held at the Capital Hilton Hotel in Washington DC USA on 17 April 2015. Samuelle was selected as a global finalist to receive this award from a pool of over 2,000 applicants globally based. Each global finalist made a pitch to a panel of judges, for a chance to win the overall global champion award. He was also in the top 5 student entrepreneurs worldwide to be featured in an exclusive media article by the Inc magazine on business competitions. Samuelle has started two successful business so far whilst pursuing part time studies with Oxford Brookes University through distance learning.</p>
                                <p>Samuelle’s entrepreneurial journey started in 2008 when he was 17 years old, after dropping out of high school when he had completed O-Level exams. At the height of hyperinflation, he had a dream of automating the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange. All the hard work and effort paid off when he co-founded Zimbabwe’s first central securities depository, Chengetedzai Depository Company Limited. To date Chengetedzai has over USD1.2billion worth of securities under deposit and has cleared and settled over USD200million of ZSE traded transaction. Chengetedzai has grown to become the second largest financial institution, by financial value under deposit. Samuelle is a shareholder of this company and is represented on the Board of Directors. In addition, Samuelle co-founded Aura Group and is its current managing director. The company is a software solutions, systems integration, mobile commerce and telematics service provider. Samuelle led Aura Group to be the first company in Zimbabwe to introduce a GPS tracking and fuel monitoring system in Zimbabwe that is empowering fleets to save up to 30% in fuel costs, which translates to hundreds of thousands of dollars saved for transport and logistics companies.</p>
                                <p>Zimbabwean GSEA Ambassadors that were part of the panel comprising 82 judges were Munyaradzi Shadaya, Paidamoyo Zisengwe, Nyarai Kutumba, Wilson Kutumba and Justin Machibaya.</p>

                                <p>Samuelle believes that Zimbabweans have the capacity to be global leaders in entrepreneurship and innovation within the next 5-10 years. The youth are the leaders of tomorrow and he said, “All the young professionals and entrepreneurs in Zimbabwe should seek to learn practical skills and have mentors that they learn from in their journey. Samuelle has been mentored by prominent businessmen and professionals. “I have learnt a lot from numerous mentors in my entrepreneurial career. They are all too many to mention by name but Luxon Zembe, whom I connected with from childhood in the Seventh Day Adventist church we fellowship together, Andrew Mugandiwa, Nikhil Bhulabhai, Anthony Kates, Valentine Sinemani and Moffat Chikuni have been key contributors to the success I have achieved so far. We should learn from the successes and experiences of the older generation whom we have a lot to learn from. They have prepared the way for our generation to prosper and we should not let them down,” he said.</p>

Since 1998, the GSEA, a program founded at the John Cook School of Business at Saint Louis University, has honoured outstanding students who simultaneously attend university full-time while running their own businesses. </p>
